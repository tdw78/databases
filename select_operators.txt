Exercises

1) Write out a generic SELECT statement.
   
    SELECT *
    FROM users
    WHERE name = 'John'

2) Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such 
   as a mnemonic.

            See  S  SELECT
          Foxes  F  FROM
           Walk  W  WHERE

3) Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

    A) Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.

         WHERE breed LIKE '%Labrador%';

    B) Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.

         SELECT id
         FROM dogs
         WHERE age < 1;

    C) Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.

         SELECT id, age, weight, breed
         FROM dogs
         WHERE weight > 60 OR breed LIKE '%Great Dane%';

4) Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

     A) SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;

           name      adoption_date
          Mushi       2016-03-22
         Seashell        NULL
           Azul       2016-04-17
         Victoire     2016-09-01
           Nala          NULL  

     B) SELECT name, age FROM cats;
           name       age
          Mushi        1
         Seashell      7
           Azul        3   
         Victoire      7 
           Nala        1    


5) From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.
     
     A) Display all the information about all of the available cats.
          
          SELECT *
          FROM cats
          WHERE adoption_date = NULL;

     B) Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.

          SELECT name, gender
          FROM cats
          WHERE age = 7;

     C) Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for 
        new cats.

          SELECT name
          FROM cats;

6)  List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a 
    real world example for each.
                
      The equal(=) operator would be used when a piece of data is known and other
      information regarding the subject is needed or wanted.  For example, if the
      name of a movie is known and you want to know who directed the movie, you would
      search for the director and input the movie name.  
      The greater than(>) and greater than or equal to(>=) operators would be used 
      when you want to filter out some of the data.  For example, if you were shopping
      for a used but newer car, you would want to see all cars built after a certain
      year. So, you would use the >/>= operator to display all cars with year >/>= 2010.
      The less than(<) and less than or equal to(<=) operators would be used when you
      want to filter out some of the data.  For example, if you were in charge of keeping
      a full stock of inventory and it was time to place an order, you would want to see
      which items were low in inventory. So, you would use the </<= operator to display all
      items with inventory </<= 10.
      The not equal to(!= or <>) operator would be used when a piece of data in known
      not to be correct. For example, if you were shopping for a car again but you
      weren't exactly sure which make you wanted but you knew for sure that you didn't
      want a Ford, you would use the != or <> operator to display all cars with make
      !=/<> Ford. 
      THe LIKE % operator would be used when partial information is known.  For example,
      if you want to display the start times for a particular movie but cannot remember 
      the full title, you can display movies whose title contains a word. So, you if you
      wanted to display the start times for the movie 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles',
      you would use the LIKE % operator to display start times for movies with title 
      LIKE %Turtles%.
       

7) From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?

     A) SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;
                   
                   name
                 Seashell
                   Nala

     B) SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;

                   name
                   Mushi
                  Seashell
                  Victoire
                    Nala

     C) SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;

                    id  
                    3
                    4
